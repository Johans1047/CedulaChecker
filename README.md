# CedulaChecker

This project is designed to validate and format Panamanian **cedula** numbers according to specific patterns based on their type and prefix. The system ensures that cedula numbers conform to required formats, identifies the type, and associates a province when applicable.

## Features

- **Cedula Validation**: Validates cedula numbers according to predefined patterns for different types (e.g., Regular, Panamanian Resident, Indigenous).
- **Cedula Formatting**: Adds leading zeros to parts of the cedula to ensure proper formatting.
- **Province Identification**: Determines the province based on the cedula prefix.
